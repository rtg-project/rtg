# Graph-core

This package + Graphile migrate = Prisma migrate but in typescript, more flexible and open source

## Overview

Input:

- `real` Your postgres database
- `datamodel` A GraphQL SDL with anotations (like prisma 1)

Process

- `realSchema` is extracted by running postgraphile generate schema on `Real`, with the postgraphile configuration you use in production
- `datamodelSchema`, The full SQL schema that implements the GraphQL SDL if the `Datamodel` is generated by this tool.
- `realSchema` and `datamodelSchema` get diffed

Output:

- `current.graphql` a migration, set of changes on the graphql schema
- `current.sql` a migration file for graphile-migrate that implements these changes in your database

## How to run 

Run `yarn build:schema` in apps/graphile
